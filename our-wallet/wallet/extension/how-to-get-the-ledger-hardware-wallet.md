# How to get the Ledger Hardware Wallet

To purchase the Ledger Hardware wallet, simply go to the [Ledger website](https://shop.ledger.com/#category-cryptocurrency-wallets).

There are 3 hardware wallets available:

* Ledger Nano X
* Ledger Nano S
* Ledger Nano S Plus

While they both do the job, there are some additional features in the Ledger Nano X and Ledger Nano S Plus that aren’t available on the Ledger Nano S. You can view the differences for yourself and see which one suits you the best [here](https://shop.ledger.com/#category-cryptocurrency-wallets). If you’re simply looking for a place to store your crypto offline for the most affordable price, the Ledger Nano S does the job just fine!

We **strongly recommend** buying your Ledger device directly from their website. While nothing is 100% tamper-proof, there is a higher possibility of your device being compromised when buying from a third-party retailer.
