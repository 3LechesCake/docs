# What is Tres Leches  Finance?

Tres Leches Finance was created on October 2021, our initial goal was to create a cryptocurrency project where we can give out something back to the community. Our main goal was to create a token where we can give scholarship awards to students in need, our main focus was to launch Tres Leches Cake as our first charity project. We launched the project with a lot of ups and downs, however, did never stop us from continuing and growing our utilities. To many, a cryptocurrency that is charity based won't be successful without utilities, and to some extent they were correct.&#x20;

So what is Tres Leches Finance, is our approach to building new and better things with the right intentions. Our project has evolved from one cryptocurrency token to a family of tokens with utilities across all of them. Our initial goal was to launch in Cardano, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain. This has since evolved to become a multi-blockchain project to create our own blockchain project as well.&#x20;

Flash forward to the year 2022 and we now have a cryptocurrency wallet, a smart swap, a stacking platform, an NFT for ownership, an NFT for Dessert Rolodex, a multi-blockchain token, and much more. we continue to build, evolve and develop and most of all to give back to others as best as we can.
