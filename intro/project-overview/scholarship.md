# Scholarship

Our number one goal is to give back to the community, we intend to earn at least 1,000 USD a semester so we can give it back to a student, an institution, or a project that is focused on learning and that is willing to give more to the award winner than what we normally will give away.

Our first scholarship winner was https://incube2.com, we donated $1,000 on August 15, 2022, the first time we are able to accomplish this by ourselves. We will continue to push forward and encourage people to learn, grow, and get educated in the areas of need.&#x20;
