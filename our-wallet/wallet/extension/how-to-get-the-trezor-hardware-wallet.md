# How to get the Trezor Hardware Wallet?

To purchase the Ledger Hardware wallet, simply go to the [Trezor website](https://trezor.io/#comparison).

There are 2 Trezor hardware wallets available:

* Trezor Model T
* Trezor One

While they both do the job, there are some additional features in the Trezor Model T that aren’t available on the Trezor One that you can review [here](https://trezor.io/#comparison). If you’re simply looking for a place to store your crypto offline for the most affordable price, the Trezor One does the job just fine!

We **strongly recommend** buying your Trezor device directly from their website. While nothing is 100% tamper-proof, there is a higher possibility of your device being compromised when buying from a third-party retailer.
